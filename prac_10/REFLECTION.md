Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I was not very consistent with the estimates and did not actually write many, however most practicals took me 1-2 hours. 

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Same as above. My accuracy didn't really change, I could usually gauge how long a prac would take me. 

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I was not consistent enough with the estimates to actually learn anything. 

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I was also not very consistent with code reviews.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I was also not very consistent with code reviews.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

The practicals were set out very well and were very good learning tools. I wouldn't change anything about them if I were in charge. 

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I'm not sure if there was any one area that I did especially well in, I feel that I did moderate overall. Definitely can put more effort in.
