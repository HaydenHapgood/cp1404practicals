# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I am yet to change much about my process in the subject. I enjoy doing the coding on Sunday as I have little else
to do on Sunday as my other subjects are not too demanding, and the practicals are quite fun to do.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

It would be helpful for weeks such as this where I have been quite busy with other things such as finding a new house
to complete my work spaced throughout the week. I ended up only getting to this very late and rushing through it 
which is why my commits are so bad. Other than that which is more of an unexpected occurrence there isn't much I think
I would change.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am doing well in having fun doing the practicals. A lot of other subjects have very mundane tasks that I often get
bored doing. This subject offers a more lighthearted approach to practicals that I enjoy and which makes me look 
forward to doing them. Other than that I think I am doing well in general for this subject. 

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

One thing that I definitely need to add to my work which I will try to next week when I don't leave the practical too late
is timing my work, committing more often with better statements, and reviewing code. I left the prac too late and wasn't
able to do these to the best of my ability this week.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I think that this is one of the most well balanced subjects that I have done at JCU so far. For example, if I wasn't a 
lazy student, I am able to complete basically this entire subject whenever I would like since all the practicals are
already available. I really like when lecturers have all the content ready and hand it out from day 1, as it allows
the students to work at their own pace, whether that be excelling and going ahead of the calendar, or working at a 
weekly pace. The weekly deadlines also are a good motivator since if they weren't there I am almost certain I would have
left a lot of the pracs until the last week. If I had to suggest anything it would be to lessen on the late submission
penalty, but that is just my lazy side talking.
